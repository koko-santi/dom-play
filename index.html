       <p><span data-actor="luigi">Luigi: Their grandfather, Richard. Was the wealthiest man in modern history, you do not get that way without blood on your hands.</span></p>
       <p><span data-actor="valentina">Valentina: True, they are aware of what they have done- what they are doing. It has not stopped them yet.</span></p>
       <p><span data-actor="yana">Yana: You need to base the performance less on justice and more on revelations.</span></p>
       <p><span data-actor="atsuko">Atsuko: Yes. Do not make it so on the nose, it will upset them. Leave more up for interpretation so it sticks with them.</span></p>
       <p><span data-actor="yana">Yana: Might as well push the envelope. Not only is this, as you say, your last chance. Think of who you are presenting it to, these people can afford to see Broadway shows every night if they wanted, they have traveled the world, show them something they have never seen before. </span></p>
       <p><span data-actor="atsuko">Atsuko: That they will never forget.</span></p>
       <p><span data-actor="bruno">Bruno: At this point, it would be easier to just whack them.</span></p>
